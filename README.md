# Explainations For React Hooks I've Learned With Example Code

## To use any code, uncomment one of the components from App.js. I strongly recommend only using one component at a time

### Additionally, run "npm install" from the directory containing package-lock.json to install the necessary dependencies

So far, this repository contains examples for:

1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useContext
4. useReducer
5. useRef
6. useMemo

<br>

## The example code for useEffect, useRef, and useMemo was "greatly inspired" by the following sources:

1. useEffect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZJgIjIuY7U&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8EtggFGERCwMY5u5hOjf-h&index=2
2. useRef: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2ypzz6gJm0&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8EtggFGERCwMY5u5hOjf-h&index=4
3. useMemo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THL1OPn72vo&list=PLZlA0Gpn_vH8EtggFGERCwMY5u5hOjf-h&index=3

## The example code for useState, useContext, and useReducer all produce the <b> SAME </b> output

It is a basic app that tracks the score for two American Football teams, and you can increment the score for either team if they score a Touchdown (TD) or Field Goal (FG). I chose to do this because it clearly demonstrates how each hook is used, but also how they are useful. The code is not perfect, so maybe try to make it better?
